# Flipstackk 3.0 - Live Data Integration & Workflow Plan

## 1. Live Data Integration Workflow

### 1.1 Dashboard Real-Time Metrics
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

- **Task Metrics:** Pending tasks, overdue tasks, completion rate, team productivity
- **Offer Metrics:** Active offers, acceptance rate, average offer amount
- **Revenue Metrics:** Monthly revenue, deals closed, average deal size

**Real-Time Updates:**
- WebSocket connections for instant data updates
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds for critical metrics
- Push notifications for urgent tasks and new leads
- Live activity feed showing recent actions across the system

### 1.2 Cross-Page Data Flow

    A[Dashboard] --> B[Leads Management]
    A --> C[Buyer CRM]
    A --> D[Task Management]
    A --> E[Analytics]
    
    B --> F[Lead Details]
    F --> G[Create Task]
    F --> H[Match Buyers]
    F --> I[Create Offer]
    
    C --> J[Buyer Profile]
    J --> K[Buyer Preferences]
    J --> L[Buyer Offers]
    
    D --> M[Task Details]
    M --> N[Update Status]
    M --> O[Add Notes]
    
    H --> J
    I --> L
    G --> M
```

## 2. Task Management System Integration

### 2.1 Automated Task Generation
**Lead-Based Tasks:**
- **New Lead:** "Contact lead within 1 hour" (High Priority)
- **Qualified Lead:** "Schedule property visit" (Medium Priority)
- **Under Contract:** "Prepare closing documents" (High Priority)
- **Follow-up:** "Follow up with lead in 3 days" (Low Priority)

**Buyer-Based Tasks:**
- **New Buyer:** "Verify proof of funds" (High Priority)
- **Active Buyer:** "Send matching properties weekly" (Medium Priority)
- **Offer Submitted:** "Follow up on offer status" (High Priority)

**System-Based Tasks:**
- **Overdue Follow-ups:** Auto-generated for missed contacts
- **Document Expiry:** Remind about expiring contracts/offers

### 2.2 Task Assignment Logic
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Created] --> B{Task Type}
    B -->|Lead Related| C[Assign to Lead Owner]
    B -->|Buyer Related| D[Assign to Acquisitions Team]
    B -->|Administrative| E[Assign to Admin]
    B -->|Follow-up| F[Assign Based on Workload]
    
    C --> G[Check User Role]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Send Notification]
    H --> I[Update Dashboard]
```

### 2.3 Task Workflow States
1. **Created** → Auto-assigned based on rules
2. **Assigned** → User receives notification

    prisma.buyer.count({ where: { cashBuyer: true } }),
    prisma.task.count({ where: { status: 'PENDING' } }),
    prisma.offer.count({ where: { status: 'SENT' } })
  ]);
