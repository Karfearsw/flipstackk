# Domain Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Identified: Custom Domain Not Serving Latest Deployment

### Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, the issue has been identified:

**Primary Issue**: The custom domain `flipstackk.kevnbenestate.org` is returning a 404 Not Found error, indicating that the domain is not properly configured in Vercel to serve the application.

### Investigation Results

1. **DNS Configuration**: ✅ WORKING
   - Domain correctly points to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - DNS propagation is complete
   - Ping resolves to Vercel's IP addresses

2. **Vercel Deployment**: ✅ WORKING
   - Latest deployment URL: `https://traeflipstackk4p7yk-karfearsw-karfearsws-projects.vercel.app`
   - Application is accessible via Vercel's generated URL
   - Latest commit (0a693cd) is deployed

3. **Domain Routing**: ❌ NOT CONFIGURED
   - Custom domain returns 404 error
   - Domain is not linked to the Vercel project in Vercel dashboard

### Solution Steps

#### Immediate Fix Required:

1. **Add Custom Domain in Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to your project: `flipstackk4`
   - Go to Settings → Domains
   - Add `flipstackk.kevnbenestate.org` as a custom domain
   - Verify domain ownership if prompted

2. **Verify Domain Configuration**:
   - Ensure the domain points to the production deployment
   - Check that SSL certificate is properly configured
   - Confirm domain is set as primary (if desired)

#### Alternative Workaround:

If you cannot access Vercel dashboard immediately, the application is fully functional at:
- **Working URL**: `https://traeflipstackk4p7yk-karfearsw-karfearsws-projects.vercel.app`

### Prevention Measures for Future Deployments

1. **Automated Domain Configuration**:
   ```json
   // Add to vercel.json
   {
     "domains": ["flipstackk.kevnbenestate.org"]
   }
   ```

2. **Deployment Verification Checklist**:
   - [ ] Verify Vercel deployment succeeds
   - [ ] Test generated Vercel URL
   - [ ] Confirm custom domain serves latest version
   - [ ] Check SSL certificate status
   - [ ] Verify environment variables are set

3. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Set up uptime monitoring for custom domain
   - Configure alerts for deployment failures
   - Implement health checks for critical endpoints

### Technical Details

- **Current Deployment**: `0a693cd` (Production deployment: Complete Flipstack CRM)
- **Vercel Project**: Connected and functional
- **DNS Status**: Properly configured, pointing to Vercel
- **Issue**: Domain not added to Vercel project configuration

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add custom domain in Vercel dashboard
2. **Short-term**: Verify domain serves latest deployment
3. **Long-term**: Implement automated domain configuration and monitoring

### Contact Information

If issues persist after adding the domain in Vercel dashboard:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure DNS propagation is complete (may take up to 48 hours)
